## Why

If you want to analyse the full content of a Whatsapp chat export,  WhatsappChatConverter can help you by generating multiple exports of the content.
The app will generate multiple export formats so you can read the data in multiple ways.

## Installation

Download the app for your OS using the buttons on the top of the page and run the executable in the same folder you have your chat export.

## Usage

Double click on the app or execute on a terminal window.

![execution example Mac OS](https://github.com/russoedu/WhatsappChatConverter/blob/gh-pages/terminal-mac.png?raw=true)

The app will try to find a "_chat.txt" file.

If "_chat.txt" is not found you'll be presented the option to select a zip or a txt (from the files in the app folder).

When the chat is found all the process will run and the result files will be saved in the `WhatsappConversion` folder.

## Contact replacement

You can replace the contacts names by changing the file `replacement.json` that will be created in the app folder.

All contacts found in the chat will be included and you can, for instance, change phone number for people's real names to make it easier to analyse the chat.

```
[
    {
        "original": "+44 07425-98989",
        "replacement": "John Doe"
    },
    {
        "original": "+55 11 8956-5452",
        "replacement": "Mary Jane"
    },
    {
        "original": "Paul",
        "replacement": "Paul Roberts"
    },
    {
        "original": "Mary Jane",
        "replacement": "Mary Jane"
    },
    {
        "original": "John Doe",
        "replacement": "John Doe"
    }
]

```

Change the contento of each "replacement" and run the app again to have the updated version with the replacements.
